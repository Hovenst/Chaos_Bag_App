CreateBagScenario encoding

What information is needed?
How best to organize that information?
What needs to be delivered to the next activity?

Info needed:
Campaign
- 10 regular
- 10 Standalones (actually more for 2-part scenarios)
- 10 Parallel
Scenario
- 8-10 per campaign
Difficulty
- 4 + Standalone for each scenario
Context
- See below

Translate this encoding into a bag
- List of every single possible bag?
- Probably lots more efficient to build the bag like you do in-game
Campaign > difficulty > scenario + modifiers

Other info
- Context information for campaign to make bag with
- Maybe settled on 4 here? Unsure what all would be needed
